## 1. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

This project addresses the critical need for timely and accurate pneumonia diagnosis, especially in resource-limited healthcare settings. It leverages deep learning to analyze chest X-ray images and provide automated diagnostic support. The core of the project is a hybrid model that integrates EfficientNetV2 (a CNN) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), enhanced by attention mechanisms like CBAM and BreastNet blocks. This architecture is designed to capture both local features and global dependencies within the images, leading to improved classification accuracy. 

## 2. Background <a name="background"></a>

Deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, with CNNs and ViTs playing a crucial role. 

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs, particularly EfficientNetV2, are effective in capturing local patterns and fine-grained details in images, which are essential for identifying pneumonia-related features in X-rays. 
* **Vision Transformers (ViTs):** ViTs excel at learning global relationships and long-range dependencies within images, providing context that CNNs might miss.
* **Hybrid Models:** Combining CNNs and ViTs leverages the strengths of both architectures, leading to more robust and accurate image classification. 
* **Attention Mechanisms:** Modules like CBAM and BreastNet enhance the model's ability to focus on diagnostically relevant regions in the X-ray images.
